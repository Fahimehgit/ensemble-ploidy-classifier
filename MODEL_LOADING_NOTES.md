# Model Loading Notes

## PyTorch Version Compatibility

Your pre-trained models were saved with an older version of PyTorch. Starting with PyTorch 2.6, there are stricter security restrictions on loading models. Here are the solutions:

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Option 1: Use `weights_only=False` (Recommended for trusted models)

```python
import torch

# When loading your trained models, use:
model = torch.load("model_file.pt", map_location=device, weights_only=False)
```

### Option 2: Add Safe Globals

```python
import torch
from your_script import DynamicLeNet  # Import the class definition

# Add the class to safe globals
torch.serialization.add_safe_globals([DynamicLeNet])
model = torch.load("model_file.pt", map_location=device, weights_only=True)
```

### Option 3: Use Context Manager

```python
import torch
from your_script import DynamicLeNet

# Use safe globals context manager
with torch.serialization.safe_globals([DynamicLeNet]):
    model = torch.load("model_file.pt", map_location=device)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è For Package Users

If users encounter model loading issues, they should:

1. **Trust the source**: Your models are safe, so using `weights_only=False` is fine
2. **Use the model loader utility**: The package includes utilities that handle this automatically
3. **Upgrade PyTorch**: Newer versions have better compatibility

## üì¶ Package Status

‚úÖ **Package imports work perfectly**
‚úÖ **Model creation and inference work perfectly**  
‚úÖ **Configuration system works perfectly**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Pre-trained model loading needs PyTorch compatibility handling**

The package is **ready for GitHub** - the model loading issue is just a version compatibility matter that users can easily resolve with the provided solutions.

## üí° For New Models

When training new models, save them with:

```python
# Save with state dict (recommended)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pt")

# Or save full model with explicit settings
torch.save(model, "model.pt", pickle_protocol=4)
```

This ensures better forward compatibility.
